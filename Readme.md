## Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project deals with predicting whether or not a loan should be sanctioned based on several features such as:
- Loan_ID
- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status

The following models were tested to see which of them would be most suitable for the experiment:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive Bayes

As the amount of data was considerably small, a 5-Fold cross validation was done to evaluate the models.
